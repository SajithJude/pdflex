Payment to innocent purchaser of money found on accused. \u2014When any person is convicted of any \noffence which includes, or amounts to, theft or receiving stolen property, and i t is proved that  any other person \nbought the stolen property from him without knowing  or  having reason to believe  that the same was stolen, and \nthat any money has on his arrest been taken out of the possession of  the convicted person, the Court may, on t he \napplication of such purchaser and on the restitution of the stolen property to the person  entitled to the possession \nthereof, order that out of such money a sum not exceeding the price paid by such purchaser be delivered to him.  \n454.
